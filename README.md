# Ai-Voice-Chatter-python-streamlit
Ai Speech-to-Speech chatbot with streamlit and DialoGPT.

## **How to use:**

1- Clone the repository to your local.

2- Install packages in requirements.txt:
>> pip install -r requirements.txt.

3- Open the CMD panel again, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and write the following command:
>> streamlit run chatter.py

4- If the browser's window did't open automatically, go to the Local URL: http://localhost:****.

P.S.: **** indicates the local host shown on the CMD, e.g. 8081

5- Make sure that your microphone on your local is allowing apps to access it: 
For Windows: *Settings -> Microphone Privacy Settings -> turn "Allow apps to access your microphone"* on.

6- Once the chatter.py is loaded to the browser, you can click the "Speak" button and speak clearly with short and one sentence at a time (Like do not read a statement and expect the chatbot to answer you :D).

P.S.:You do not need to continuously press the speak button while you speak, just click it once and start, once you finish speaking, the chatbot will wait for couple of seconds and then will answer you (with voice and text).

7- For better performance, try to refresh the site after 5 speak tries (Issue related to the pretrained model).

8- Have fun ;)

9- Do not forget to chack the references, **kindly keep the source info.**

**Since this is a pretrained model, the answeres may be unexpected, so we are not responsible for any inapproprate answeres that may occur.**
